      <p class="about">
        ToBeBookFair is a little social enterprise aiming to make big changes to
        children’s reading. We genuinely care about promoting reading for
        pleasure and the love for books. Think of us as the little independent
        bookstore on your device. And it isn’t just selling books we care about.
        We want to put books and opportunities in the hands of as many kids as
        we can. Our profits will go towards helping schools get book stock. Not
        just schools though, any organisation that would benefit from a
        dedicated space and book stock like hospitals, care homes etc. When you
        shop with us you can choose to use your discount on your purchases or
        donate the difference to help us help kids.

    <!-- Data Explanation -->
    <div class="data-text">
      <h2>How Important is it for children to own books?</h2>
      <p>
        The National Literacy Trust collected data from <b>50,376</b> children
        between the ages of 8-18 in 2023. The report showed the importance of
        children owning their own books. Also how most children who own books
        enjoy reading and read daily. <br /><br />However the NLT's report
        displayed the data in such a way that makes the difference between
        owning books and not owning books look drastic. The data only shows
        slight improvement in a child's connection to reading when owning a book
        however this data collection didn't take into account whether the
        parents or the child were selecting the books. Children who own books
        and don't enjoy reading may only own books they are not interested in.
        This data does't prove that owning books is not worth it.
